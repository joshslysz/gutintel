    "description": "Carrageenan is a food additive extracted from red seaweed (Chondrus crispus) and commonly used as a thickener, stabilizer, and emulsifier in processed foods including dairy products, plant-based milks, and deli meats. While approved by food safety authorities, emerging research suggests potential negative effects on gut health, particularly related to intestinal inflammation and microbiome disruption.",

    "safety_notes": "Generally recognized as safe by regulatory agencies, but emerging research suggests potential gut health concerns. May cause digestive inflammation in sensitive individuals. Those with inflammatory bowel conditions may want to limit exposure. Degraded carrageenan (poligeenan) is more concerning than food-grade carrageenan.",
